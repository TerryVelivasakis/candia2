<h6><Center>PERSONAL GUARANTY</center></h6>
<ol>
<li><p>For value received and in consideration of and in order to induce <?PHP echo $property['propertyLLC'] ?>,  (the "Landlord") to enter into that certain Lease Agreement dated the <?php echo date("jS \of F, Y"); ?>, between Landlord and  	<?php echo $tenantName;?>				(the "Tenant"), for space at <?PHP echo $property['propertyName'] ?> (the "Lease") and other good and valuable considerations, the undersigned (hereinafter sometimes called the "Guarantor"), acting as principal and not as surety, absolutely, unconditionally, irrevocably, independent of Tenant’s obligations under the Lease, for himself and his legal representatives, successors, and assigns, guarantees to Landlord and to its legal representatives, successors, and assigns, the prompt and full performance and observance by Tenant and by its legal representatives, successors, and assigns, of all of the covenants, terms, provisions, conditions, and agreements required to be performed by Tenant under the Lease, whether prior to, during the Term of, or after the termination of the Term of the Lease.</li>

<li><p>The capitalized terms used in this Guaranty shall have the same definitions as such capitalized terms have in the Lease unless the context clearly indicates a contrary intent.</li>

<li><p>Notice of all defaults is waived and consent is given to all extensions of time that Landlord may grant to Tenant in the performance of any of the terms of the Lease and/or to the waiving in whole or in part of any such performance, and/or to the releasing of Tenant in whole or in part from any such performance, and/or to the adjusting of any dispute in connection with the Lease; and no such defaults, extensions, waivers, releases, or adjustments, with or without the knowledge of the undersigned, shall affect or discharge the liability of the undersigned.  The undersigned further agrees to pay all expenses, including legal fees and disbursements paid or incurred by Landlord in endeavoring to enforce this Guaranty.

<li><p>	This Guaranty shall not be impaired by, and the undersigned consents to, any modification, supplement, extension, or amendment of the Lease to which the parties thereto may hereafter agree.  The liability of the Guarantor hereunder is direct and unconditional and may be enforced without requiring Landlord first to resort to any other right, remedy, or security.  The Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, reimbursement, or indemnity whatsoever, nor any right of recourse to security for the debts and obligations of Tenant to Landlord.

<li><p>This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty which shall be and remain effective prior to the commencement of the Term of the Lease, during the Term and renewal or extension of all or any portion of the Lease, and as to any surviving provisions that remain effective after the termination of the Lease.
	Time is of the essence in this Guaranty.
<li><p>	The liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall in no way be affected, modified, or diminished by reason of (a) any assignment, renewal, modification, amendment, or extension of the Lease, or (b) any modification or waiver of or change in any of the terms, covenants, and conditions of the Lease by Landlord and Tenant, or (c) any extension of time that may be granted by Landlord to Tenant, or (d) any consent, release, indulgence, or other action, inaction, or omission under or in respect of the Lease, or (e) any dealings or transactions or matter or thing occurring between Landlord and Tenant, or (f) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, arrangement, assignment for the benefit of creditors, receivership, trusteeship, or similar proceeding affecting Tenant, or the rejection or disaffirmance of the Lease in any such proceedings, whether or not notice thereof or of any thereof is given to Guarantor, or (g) the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of Tenant under the Lease.  The liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall continue during any time Tenant remains in possession or occupancy or is using the Premises or any portion thereof whether by virtue of holding over or otherwise.
<li><p>	Should Landlord be obligated by any bankruptcy or other law to repay to Tenant or to Guarantor or to any trustee, receiver, or other representative of either of them, any amounts previously paid, this Guaranty shall be reinstated in the amount of such repayments.  Landlord shall not be required to litigate or otherwise dispute its obligations to make such repayments if it in good faith believes that such obligation exists.
<li><p>	For purposes of this Guaranty, upon a default by Tenant under the Lease the entire balance of all forms of Rent due under the Lease for the remainder of the Term of the Lease may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in the Lease notwithstanding any stay, injunction, or other prohibition preventing such declaration as against Tenant and, in the event of any such declaration by Landlord, such obligations (whether or not due and payable by Tenant) shall forthwith become due and payable by Guarantor under this Guaranty.
	<li><p>No delay on the part of Landlord in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Guaranty or failure to exercise the same shall operate as a waiver of or otherwise affect any such right, power, or privilege, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege.

	<li><p>No waiver or modification of any provision of this Guaranty nor any termination of this Guaranty shall be effective unless in writing and signed by Landlord; nor shall any such waiver be applicable except in the specific instance for which given.
	<li><p>All of Landlord's rights and remedies under the Lease and under this Guaranty, now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise, are intended to be distinct, separate, and cumulative and no exercise or partial exercise of any such right or remedy therein or herein mentioned is intended to be in exclusion of or a waiver of any of the others.
	<li><p>If more than one guaranty is in effect at any time with respect to the Lease, each guarantor will be jointly and severally liable with each other guarantor for payment and performance of such guaranty.
	<li><p>Guarantor agrees that it will, at any time and from time to time within ten (10) days following written request by Landlord, execute, acknowledge, and deliver to Landlord a statement certifying that this Guaranty is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if there have been modifications, that the same is in full force and effect as modified and stating such modifications). Guarantor agrees that such certificate may be relied on by Landlord and by anyone holding or proposing to acquire any interest in the Premises from or through Landlord or by any mortgagee or prospective mortgagee of the Building or Premises or of any interest therein.  Guarantor further agrees that it will, at any time and from time to time, within ten (10) days following written request by Landlord, provide Landlord such information regarding the financial condition of Guarantor as Landlord may reasonably request.
<li><p>	If Landlord assigns the Lease or sells the Building, Landlord may assign this Guaranty to such assignee or transferee, who shall thereupon succeed to the rights of Landlord under this Guaranty to the same extent as if such assignee were an original guaranteed party named in this Guaranty, and the same rights shall accrue to each subsequent assignee of this Guaranty.  If Tenant assigns or sublets the Premises, the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect.
	<li><p>If any provision of this Guaranty or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of that provision and this Guaranty and the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or enforceable shall not be affected thereby, and the remainder of such provision and this Guaranty shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.
	<li><p>As a further inducement to Landlord to make and enter into the Lease and in consideration of Landlord's execution of the Lease, Landlord and Guarantor waive trial by jury in any action or proceeding brought on, under, or by virtue of this Guaranty.
	<li><p>Without regard to principles of conflicts of laws, the validity, interpretation, performance, and enforcement of this Guaranty shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the state of Florida and shall be deemed to have been made and performed in the state of Florida.
	<li><p>Guarantor irrevocably consents that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or in any way connected with this Guaranty may be instituted or brought by Landlord or its agents in any court (federal or state) located in Pinellas County, Florida, and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such court in any such legal action or proceeding.
	<li><p>Landlord has entered into the Lease on the condition that Guarantor shall maintain a minimum net worth ("Minimum Net Worth"), which is not less than the Guarantor's net worth as set forth in the financial statements submitted by Guarantor to Landlord prior to the making of the Lease, or if no financial statements were submitted by Guarantor to Landlord, then below a level deemed acceptable by Landlord in its sole and absolute discretion.  Consequently, within fifteen (15) days after Landlord's request, Guarantor will furnish to Landlord, Guarantor's most recent financial statements, IRS tax returns and W-2 forms for the immediately preceding 2 calendar years, pay stubs for the immediately preceding 12 pay periods, all bank account (checking, savings, money-market and the like) statements for the immediately preceding 24 months in which Guarantor was named on the account, credit card statements for the preceding 24 months in which Guarantor was authorized to sign, credit applications for the preceding 24 months, credit reports obtained from any credit reporting agencies for the preceding 24 months, and any other financial records which would be discoverable in aid of execution in the State of Florida.  Guarantor agrees that Landlord and its agents and attorneys have the right to obtain Guarantor’s personal credit reports and financial statements from Guarantor, Guarantor's creditors, and other third parties in connection with the extension of credit pursuant to this Guaranty, subsequently in connection with its interest in determining Guarantor's financial condition at any time during the term of this Guaranty, and after the term of this Guaranty until all obligations under this Guaranty are fully discharged. Any of Landlord's requests for documents and information as set forth herein may be made at any time during and after the Term of the Lease, during and after the term of this Guaranty, including but not limited to periods when enforcement and collection litigation in connection with the Lease or this Guaranty is taking place, and in such litigation, such records shall be deemed discoverable without objection from Guarantor and all objections thereto shall be deemed and are hereby waived.  During such periods, Guarantor will discuss its financial statements with Landlord and will give Landlord access to Guarantor's books and records in order to enable Landlord to verify the financial statements and other financial information.  The failure of Guarantor to strictly comply with the foregoing the requirements of this paragraph, time being of the essence, shall constitute a material default of this Guaranty. Landlord will not disclose any aspect of Guarantor's financial statements that Guarantor designates to Landlord as confidential except (a) to Landlord's consultants, lenders or prospective purchasers of the Project, (b) in litigation between Landlord and Tenant, and (c) if required by court order.  Landlord has the right to report to others its credit experience.  Landlord has the right to contact Guarantor’s major creditors to discuss the status of the Lease and this Guaranty, the credit and payment history of Guarantor, Guarantor's financial condition, and any other relevant matters. Upon request, Landlord will inform Guarantor of the name and address of each consumer reporting agency from which a credit report is obtained.
	<li><p>Should Guarantor's net worth fall below the Minimum Net Worth level as a result of a transfer of Guarantor's assets or an increase in Guarantor's liabilities and not as a result of fluctuations in the market value of Guarantor's assets, such event shall constitute a default under this Guaranty and under the Lease.  In such event, Landlord may declare all forms of Rent due under the Lease for the remainder of the Term of the Lease to be forthwith due and payable notwithstanding any stay, injunction, or other prohibition preventing such declaration as against Tenant and, in the event of any such declaration by Landlord, such obligations (whether or not due and payable by Tenant) shall forthwith become due and payable by Guarantor under this Guaranty.
