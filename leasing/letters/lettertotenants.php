Dear <?php echo $tenantName;?>:<br>
<br>

<p>
  The attached notice is a procedural formality that needs to take place.  We are not intent on terminating your tenancy, however, we do require you to sign a new lease.  We will be preparing new leases over the next week for execution at the same rate you are currently paying.  Please email info@candiatower.com or call (727) 300-5040 to schedule an appointment to review and sign your new lease.
</p>

<p>
  The requirements we maintain for our leases are similar to the lease you may have had with the prior owner.  We require a security deposit equal to 125% of your monthly rent and a copy of a valid state issued identification card.  Should you have a prepaid last month's rent we will apply it to your first month's rent under the new lease and any additional security deposit that may be required.  If you wish to have your lease in a company name instead of your personal name we will require a personal guarantee as well.
</p>

<p>
  Should you decide not to move forward with a new lease, the move out requirements of the attached notice will be upheld.  Your existing security deposit will be returned to your forwarding address.  Failure to sign a new lease or to vacate the property on or before July 31, 2021 will result in hold over tenancy.
</p>
<p>
  We hope that you continue your tenancy here at Candia Tower and we look forward to working with you to help grow your business.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Terry Velivasakis and Christina Kambouris</p>
<p>The Candia Tower Management Team</p>
